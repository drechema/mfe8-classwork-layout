# Exercise 1

The objetive is to create a dynamic color palette using Sass

In order to use Sass we need to use a web application bundler. In this project I am using **parcel**.

For testing you should have parcel installed first

```bash
sudo npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

Test the application

```bash
parcel ./src/index.html
```
